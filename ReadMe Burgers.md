Title: Burger Consuming Tracker

Introduction: The functionality of this application is to allow the user to enter a burger that they woud like to 'consume'. Once the user submits the type of burger, it is added to a list of burgers that are ready to be consumed. The user can click 'Eat-Me' and the burer will be moved into a new list of consued burgers.

Technologies: HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node, Handlebars

Launch: The application launches upon connecting to the homepage. This is localhost OR the SQL server that we also connect to.

Programming Scope: In this project, we use object relational mapping (ORM) to construct methods (reusable construction queries). By creating the ORM and requring it on our server, we can access the ORM through dot notation from the server.

Potential Future Plans: A way to dynamically create a burger with individual ingredients. A timer to let the user know how long it will be before the burger will be added to the 'ready to be consumed' list.

Additional Notes: The final author of this application is Joey Davidson. He can be reached at j.davidson18@gmail.com
